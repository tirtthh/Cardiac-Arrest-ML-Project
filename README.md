# Cardiac-Arrest-ML-Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of cardiac arrest in patients based on various clinical and physiological features. By analyzing patient data, the model identifies patterns that may indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrest, allowing healthcare professionals to intervene proactively.
